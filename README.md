# Holly's FIRST MECHANICAL KEEB WEEEEEEE
As a way to indoctrinate you into the hobby, I've put together a mech keeb kit comprised of both components that I've designed + printed, and purchased off-the-shelf stuff. I've left room in the design so that in the future you can make your own decisions on additions/upgrades as you see fit. Sorry for teasing it for so long, I realized it was much easier to just give up on designing my own electronics and just outsource dat ish lmao. I hope this board treats you well.

## Features
