# Holly's FIRST MECHANICAL KEEB WEEEEEEE
As a way to indoctrinate you into the hobby, I've put together a mech keeb kit comprised of both components that I've designed + printed, and purchased off-the-shelf stuff. I've left room in the design so that in the future you can make your own decisions on additions/upgrades as you see fit. Sorry for teasing it for so long, I realized it was much easier to just give up on designing my own electronics and just outsource dat ish lmao. I hope it treats you well.

## Features
* NovelKeys x Kailh Cream switches - unlubed
* DZ60RGB PCB - Hotswap Friendly
* Programmable over USB cable with VIA for the potential of having completely custom key presses (Name of opensource software)
* Printed PETG (Recyclable if you decide to upgrade it!!) case with transparent filament
* Heat-set threaded inserts 
* Smiley Keycaps :)
