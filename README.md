# Holly's FIRST MECHANICAL KEEB WEEEEEEE
As a way to indoctrinate you into the hobby, I've put together a mech keeb kit comprised of both components that I've designed + printed, and purchased off-the-shelf stuff. I've left room in the design so that in the future you can make your own decisions on additions/upgrades as you see fit (happy to discuss what can be upgraded!). Sorry for teasing it for so long (I wish it was better for how long it took), I realized it was much easier to just give up on designing my own electronics and just outsource dat ish lmao. I hope this board treats you well, and once again, thanks for being friends with my mentally ill ass for all these years. 

## Features / What's in (and not because I totally didn't forget) the box
* NovelKeys x Kailh Cream switches - unlubed, but lube, lubing station, and lube brush included! 
    * These are made from POM (Delrin) and are known to self-lubricate as they wear, but the typing experience is definitely enhanced with manual lubing!
* DZ60RGB PCB - Hotswap Friendly so you can put in whatever switches you want
* Sound damping foam underneath the PCB
* Programmable over USB cable with VIA for the potential of having completely custom key presses
    * You will be able to program the LEDs and keys to your liking through this software
* 1x - Keyboard Stand, also printed in CF-PA6
* Multiple Keyboard Plates ((1x - 4mm CF-PA6 Plate) + (1x - 3mm CF-PA6 Plate) + (1x - IForgot mm ABS Plate)) Use in conjunction or isolated for a different feel
    * I thought I had the correct DXF but I didn't lmao, had to make my own sketch
* USB-C Cable -- FUCK I FORGOT TO PUT IT IN THE BOX LOL
* Extra kinda shitty but shiny lights keycaps -- FUCK I FORGET THESE TOO ;___;
* Keeb Case - Printed in 2 main parts with PETG (Recycleable!), heat-set inserts used for fasteners (I fucked it up a little sooo expect an updated version in the future that looks nicer too) 
* Smiley Keycaps :) - Doubleshot PBT
* Fasteners (I NEED TO ORDER/VENMO YOU SOME M2X4 button or socket heads cuz I definitely didn't run out and substituted longer ones for shipping)
* Keycap and Keyswitch puller (1x plastic for keycaps, 1x metal for keyswitch)
* 1x - Metal Keycap deconstructor thing 
* Rubber Feet - Yup. Forgot those too lajnfg;lewigjkha;ewl






# Summarized Instructions (don't worry, fun drawings will be included as requested)
1. Remove all fasteners from assembly, they were just for shipping. 
2. Disassemble switches
3. Looooooooooooob it up
4. Reassemble switches
5. Place damping foam underneath the PCB, position PCB into place and lay the switch plate on top. Loosely fasten with M2x4 button/socket heads -- don't tighten all the way yet to allow for slight movement if needed when inserting switches.
6. INSERT DA SWITCHES, make sure the pins are oriented correctly and YAYEET
7. Now tighten the plate all the way
8. Keycaps! Put them on.
9. Download VIA and plug in the keeb with any ol' USB-C Cable, program the keeb to your liking
10. Type fun stuff like peepeepoopoo butthole america idk
